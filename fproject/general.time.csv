Regarding the upcoming Lab `Customer Analysis Round 3` : I inspected it and reworked the instructions. Please take the same data, but take these instructions:

&gt; For this lab, we still keep using the `marketing_customer_analysis.csv` file. You can find the file in the `files_for_lab` folder.
&gt; 
&gt; *Get the data*
&gt; Use the same jupyter file from the last lab, `Customer Analysis Round 3`
&gt; 
&gt; *EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) - Complete the following tasks to explore the data:*
&gt; * Show DataFrame info.
&gt; * Describe DataFrame.
&gt; * Show a plot of the total number of `response`s broken down by response kind.
&gt; * Show a plot of the ~response rate~ number of `response`s by the `sales channel`.
&gt; * ~Show a plot of the response rate by the total claim amount.~ Show a plot of the distribution of the `total claim amount`, broken down by `response` kind. Try a boxplot and distribution plot, for each `response` kind. For the distribution plot, try to plot both kinds of responses in one chart (you can try with seaborn's histplot, using the `hue` parameter).
&gt; * ~Show a plot of the response rate by income.~ Create similar plots like in the task before, but for `Income`
&gt; * *NEW*: Create a scatterplot between `total claim amount` and `income`. Play around with the parameters of the scatterplot (markersize? alpha?) and try to identify more features within the data just visually. You can also try different seaborn plots.

25/03/2021 17:35,Florian,"ok, Sian already answered while I was typing. :grin:

The function serves the purpose to be able to ""atomize"" tasks. (Not only) in data analytics, we're facing the problem to be just overwhelmed by the task in front of us. So the general approach is: break the task into smaller tasks, which then get broken down again into smaller tasks etc.... and for the lowest ones, you would write a function, solve that problem, and then go one level up, reusing that function and solve the problem on the next higher difficulty level (related to _First Principles thinking_ I guess).

In practical terms, when it comes to code, this has the advantange that your code is - as Sian said -
â€¢ *scalable* (you don't need to reinvent the wheel at higher levels),
â€¢ your code is *reusable* for yourself and others,
â€¢ your code is *outsourcable* when you put it in functions*,* out of a notebook for example, to keep your Notebook clear and reduced to only the things you want to show (most of the time, it's the results). You would then import it as we import e.g. pandas right now, `from my_module import my_function` (we can have a workshop on that)
â€¢  it's *robust.* if one function fails to do the job, it may break, but the rest of the code may continue running. You can even implement Error handling in exactly that function to get information in case of an error, why it failed (comes later in the bootcamp, crucial for example in _Webscraping_)
â€¢ it's easier to maintain / repair / upgrade. Dependencies are much easier to handle etc.
â€¢ Personal feeling: It feels nicer in my head to solve a problem piece by piece
Of course, all of this is merely theoretical at this point but as tasks become more and more complex, you're starting to whish for functions :slightly_smiling_face:",,,,U01SJKB2MG8,1616690850,U01RRV4JX6Z

  return y```
they also just mimic the concept of functions in math as a relation between two sets (elements of set X are associated with exactly one element of set Y).

_""We here at Ironhack wouldÂ like to invite all our students to a special online exit roomÂ event next Friday at 19.00._
_This is a great way to get in contact with studentsÂ from other courses._
_During the event you will be split into small group and through the use of a camera you will steer a real life gamester through a series off puzzles. We did this event last bootcamp and it was alot of fun, some students had to protect the world against a deadly zombie virus while others had to defuse an atomic bom!!_
_If this sounds like something you would be interested in please let us know by filling out thisÂ <https://ironhack-dot-yamm-track.appspot.com/Redirect?ukey=1lXsSGMtJ2C_SRHOCRp9C47W8sjM-aaI6CM0TUwUmV44-286680014&amp;key=YAMMID-04245215&amp;link=https%3A%2F%2Fironhack.typeform.com%2Fto%2FMbnfwBkS|survey>.""_

*Hang*Â Â [09:17]
HeyÂ @sian d, thanks for raising it! I gave them 2 deadlines.

â€¢ Sunday, week 3 - Having applied all suggestions from CareerhackÂ  stage 1 on their linkedin &amp; CV (without activating the optimisation tool, resumeworded)
â€¢ Sunday, week 7 - Having optimised their linkedin &amp; CV WITH resumeworded to a score of at least 70
[09:19] the reason why i split this is because they only have a 60 premium access to resumeworded, which I want them to activate in the 2nd half of their bootcamp.

So after the deadline week 3, I am doing a workshop in week 4 on wednesday evening to already give them an understanding what recruiters look out for. Weeks 4-7 are more for optimisation because thatâ€™s also when the bootcamp starts getting busier.
[09:21] let me know if this is clear, I do understand that this staged process can be a bit confusing - will make it clearer for the next bootcamp.",,3,,U01RW140HBP,1617696641,

 :microscope: *regarding the today's labs (after lecture/lunch)*
please stick to these ""improved"" instructions (and not the ones you find under the github link):

â€¢ *Lab | SQL Queries - Lesson 2.5*
1. Select all the actors with the first name â€˜Scarlettâ€™.
2. How many films (movies) are available for rent and how many films have been rented?
3. What are the shortest and longest movie duration? Return the results as columns with the namesÂ Â `max_duration`Â andÂ `min_duration`.
4. What's the average movie duration expressed in format (hours, minutes) Return the result as columns with the namesÂ `hours`Â andÂ `minutes`?
5. How many distinct (different) actors' last names are there?
6. Since how many days has the company been operating (check theÂ `DATEDIFF()`Â function)? Hint: rental table
7. Show all rental information with additional columnsÂ `month`Â andÂ `weekday`. (hint:Â `DATE_FORMAT()`Â ). Get 20 results.
8. Add an additional columnÂ `day_type`Â with valuesÂ _'weekend'_Â andÂ _'workday'_Â depending on the rental day of the week.
9. How many rentals were made in the last month of renting activity?
.... stay tuned, improved instructions for the other labs will maybe follow",,,,U01SJKB2MG8,,
06/04/2021 10:27,Florian,"<!channel>,
:microscope: for *Lab | SQL Queries - Lesson 2.6*
please use these instructions

1. Get the unique release years.
2. Get all films with _ARMAGEDDON_ in the title.
3. Get all films which title ends with _APOLLO_.
4. Get 10 the longest films.
5. How many films include *Behind the Scenes* content?
6. Drop column `picture` from `staff`.
7. A new person is hired to help Jon. Her name is TAMMY SANDERS, and she is a customer. Update the database accordingly.
8. Add a rental for movie ""Academy Dinosaur"" by the customer ""Charlotte Hunter"" from employee Mike Hillyer at Store 1. You can use current date for the `rental_date` column in the `rental` table. *Hint*: Check the columns in the table rental and see what information you would need to add there. You can query those pieces of information in other tables. For eg., you would notice that you need `customer_id` information as well. To get that you can use the following query: 
```select customer_id from sakila.customer
where first_name = 'CHARLOTTE' and last_name = 'HUNTER';```
Use similar method to get `inventory_id`, `film_id`, and `staff_id`.

9. *(Optional, you can skip this)* Delete non-active users, but first, create a _backup table_ `deleted_users` to store `customer_id`, `email`, and the `date` (use `CURDATE()` , <https://www.w3schools.com/sql/func_mysql_curdate.asp|link>) for the users that would be deleted. Follow these steps:
    â—¦ Check if there are any non-active users
    â—¦ Create a table _`backup table`_ as suggested
    â—¦ Insert the non active users in the table _`backup table`_
    â—¦ Delete the non active users from the table _`customer`_",,6,,U01SJKB2MG8,1617704853,
